      <div class="text-block-4">Stark depictions of shipwrecks in the ocean, alluding to histories of transatlantic slavery, precede this declaration. The Atlantic Ocean is a liminal space between Africa and the USA: the site that connects the present to the past. As the site of the Transatlantic Slave Trade, it holds a devastating significance in the history of the Black diaspora. Between 1501 until 1866, at least 12.5 million enslaved Africans were forcibly transported across the Atlantic to the Americas. Approximately two million Africans – about 15 percent – died during the traumatic journey across the Atlantic, known as the Middle Passage.</div>

    <div class="text-block-5">The Triangular Trade was an industrial system. European ships departed to Africa in order to trade manufactured goods with African rulers and slave traders. Ships then transported enslaved Africans across the Atlantic, usually to Brazil, followed by the West Indies, and the North American colonies. The returns of trade were then used to purchase products like tobacco, sugar, or rum for the European market.<br><br>In coastal slave castles of West Africa, like Cape Coast Castle and Elmina Castle, enslaved Africans were held in brutally violent conditions. The “Door of No Return” represented the final point of contact with African soil before being forced onto ships bound for the Americas. Aboard the ships, the enslaved endured horrific conditions squeezed in confined space. Enslaved Africans had different forms of resistance. Mutinies, suicides, and hunger strikes were common acts of defiance. According to estimates, one in every ten voyages faced revolts by enslaved Africans.</div>

      <div class="text-block-6">Despite the Abolition of the Slave Trade Act passed by the United Kingdom in 1807, which outlawed the trade of enslaved Africans, enslavement continued for decades after. It was the resistance of enslaved Africans, most notably in the Haitian Revolution of 1804, that played a pivotal role in reshaping the fight for abolition. In 1804, Haiti became the first independent nation born out of a successful revolt by enslaved people.<br><br>The notion of the Black Atlantic, as conceptualized by Guyanese-English scholar Paul Gilroy, names the web of connections across the African diaspora connected by the Atlantic Ocean. It speaks to the survival of African culture and identity despite the violence of enslavement and displacement. Africans in the diaspora managed to retain and adapt elements of their culture, creating rich, hybrid identities that influenced music, religion, and art across the world.</div>

      <div class="text-block-7">African-American cultural historian Saidiya Hartman’s “Venus in Two Acts” is a foundational text in thinking about the ethical and methodological challenges of writing history from the archives of slavery. In it, Hartman grapples with the limits of the colonial archive, particularly its silences, distortions, and violence. She focuses on the story of an enslaved girl, Venus, who appears briefly in legal records – her life reduced to the traces left by the brutalities she suffered. Hartman argues that the archive does not provide a full account of Venus’s life but rather documents the violence inflicted upon her.<br><br>One of Hartman’s key interventions is her critique of how historical narratives often reproduce colonial violence by simply recounting acts of suffering without restoring agency or complexity to the lives of the enslaved. She introduces the concept of “critical fabulation”, a method that combines historical research with speculative storytelling to imagine lives that the archive has erased. This is why poetry, with its ability to exceed linear historical narratives and embrace metaphor, rupture and ambiguity, becomes a crucial tool for engaging with histories of dispossession and violence. Poetry allows for a mode of expression that does not require empirical evidence to validate experience; it resists the demand for proof that the colonial archive imposes and instead crafts spaces where the silenced voices might be felt rather than merely documented or omitted.<br><br>Rather than filling gaps with certainty, Hartman embraces uncertainty and seeks to create a different kind of historical narrative – one that resists reducing enslaved people to quantities listed as anonymous victims and property. She challenges conventional historiography that relies on colonial records as neutral sources, emphasizing that the archive itself is a site of power, where enslaved people’s lives are often recorded only in relation to punishment, death, or sale.“When we shift our emphasis from historical recovery to rigorous and responsible creativity, we recognize that archives are not just the records bequeathed to us by the past; archives also consist of the tools we use to explore it, the vision that allows us to read its signs, and the design decisions that communicate our sense of history’s possibilities,” writes Professor of History Vincent Brown. </div>

      <div class="location">Location: Atlantic Ocean</div>
      <div class="text-block-8">In various poetry collections, the Atlantic Ocean is personified as a witness to history, seeing, writing, and roaring amongst other actions. For Dannabang Kuwabong in “Burning in Maroon Camp”, in <em>Voices from Kibuli Country</em>, the ocean is a site that holds access to history as it is personified to actively participate in the process: “where the seabed writes our history on its waves” (ref pgno). There is a promise to keep the memory of the maroons – slaves who escaped – active. This is located in the seabed, right at the bottom of the ocean. Using this spatial image, he locates the history of transatlantic slavery as foundational to the Atlantic geography, its effects seen in the “waves” created on the surface.<br><br>In “Progeny of the Air”, an early poem in Kwame Dawes’s collection <em>Duppy Conqueror</em>, opens with “The propellers undress the sea; / the pattern of foam like a broken zip / opening where the bow cuts the wave” (ref).  Commenting on this, a reviewer of the collection notes the relevance of the oceanic introduction: “This elegant image of unzipping the foam and opening the water is a brilliant initiation into the poem for the reader. Just as the water opens the wave, the poem opens to allow the reader to dive in” (Axmanda Williams, 46). <br><br>Other images respond to precise historical moments. Poets Kwadwo Opoku-Agyemang and Kwesi Brew locate their poems during specific years of early Portuguese colonisation which began in 1482. Under the command of Captain Don Diego d&#x27;Azambuja, Portuguese ships arrived in the coastal town Elmina, in what is present-day Cape Coast, Ghana. Kwamena Ansa, King of Elmina in the 15th century, interacted with Portuguese traders and negotiated alliances and trading agreements, highlighting African leaders&#x27; agency in navigating these early encounters with European powers. Bayo Holsey (2014) calls Ansa a “local legend” in oral tradition surrounding the history of Elmina and the region. The legend holds that Don Diego d&#x27;Azambuja met with King Ansa who initially rejected the request. He said, Don Diego d&#x27;Azambuja should watch the waves of the sea and study their rhythm – approaching the shore only to retreat again. He said that the Portuguese should follow this natural cycle, coming to Elmina for trade and then returning to Portugal, without erecting a permanent structure. <br><br>However, after repeated appeals, offering of gifts and threats of violence, Ansa eventually relented and permitted the construction of what is now known as Elmina Castle. His giving in is sometimes interpreted as a pragmatic move to secure trade benefits, as a gesture of diplomacy or as a reluctant concession to external pressure. Thus, the Portuguese established São Jorge da Mina Castle (Elmina Castle): the first permanent European building in West Africa.<br>‍</div>
