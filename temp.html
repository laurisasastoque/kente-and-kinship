      <div class="text-block-4">Stark depictions of shipwrecks in the ocean, alluding to histories of transatlantic slavery, precede this declaration. The Atlantic Ocean is a liminal space between Africa and the USA: the site that connects the present to the past. As the site of the Transatlantic Slave Trade, it holds a devastating significance in the history of the Black diaspora. Between 1501 until 1866, at least 12.5 million enslaved Africans were forcibly transported across the Atlantic to the Americas. Approximately two million Africans – about 15 per cent – died during the traumatic journey across the Atlantic, known as the Middle Passage.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="w-layout-vflex flex-block w-clearfix"></div>
    <div class="text-block-5">The Triangular Trade was an industrial system. European ships departed to Africa in order to trade manufactured goods with African rulers and slave traders. Ships then transported enslaved Africans across the Atlantic, usually to Brazil, followed by the West Indies, and the North American colonies. The returns of trade were then used to purchase products like tobacco, sugar, or rum for the European market.<br><br>In coastal slave castles of West Africa, like Cape Coast Castle and Elmina Castle, enslaved Africans were held in brutally violent conditions. The “Door of No Return” represented the final point of contact with African soil before being forced onto ships bound for the Americas. Aboard the ships, the enslaved endured horrific conditions, squeezed in confined space. Enslaved Africans had different forms of resistance. Mutinies, suicides, and hunger strikes were common acts of defiance. According to estimates, one in every ten voyages faced revolts by enslaved Africans.</div>

      <div class="text-block-6">Despite the Abolition of the Slave Trade Act passed by the United Kingdom in 1807, which outlawed the trade of enslaved Africans, enslavement continued for decades after. It was the resistance of enslaved Africans, most notably in the Haitian Revolution of 1804, that played a pivotal role in reshaping the fight for abolition. In 1804, Haiti became the first independent nation born out of a successful revolt by enslaved people.<br><br>The notion of the Black Atlantic, as conceptualized by Guyanese-English scholar Paul Gilroy, names the web of connections across the African diaspora connected by the Atlantic Ocean. It speaks to the survival of African culture and identity despite the violence of enslavement and displacement. Africans in the diaspora managed to retain and adapt elements of their culture, creating rich, hybrid identities that influenced music, religion, and art across the world.</div>

      <div class="text-block-7">African-American cultural historian Saidiya Hartman’s “Venus in Two Acts”<a href="#references" class="reference2"><sup class="reference2">2</sup></a> is a foundational text in thinking about the ethical and methodological challenges of writing history from the archives of slavery. In it, Hartman grapples with the limits of the colonial archive, particularly its silences, distortions, and violence. She focuses on the story of an enslaved girl, Venus, who appears briefly in legal records – her life reduced to the traces left by the brutalities she suffered. Hartman argues that the archive does not provide a full account of Venus’s life but rather documents the violence inflicted upon her.<br><br>One of Hartman’s key interventions is her critique of how historical narratives often reproduce colonial violence by simply recounting acts of suffering without restoring agency or complexity to the lives of the enslaved. She introduces the concept of “critical fabulation”,<a href="#references" class="reference2"><sup class="reference2">3</sup></a> a method that combines historical research with speculative storytelling to imagine lives that the archive has erased. <br><br>This is why poetry, with its ability to exceed linear historical narratives and embrace metaphor, rupture, and ambiguity, becomes a crucial tool for engaging with histories of dispossession and violence. Poetry allows for a mode of expression that does not require empirical evidence to validate experience; it resists the demand for proof that the colonial archive imposes and instead crafts spaces where the silenced voices might be felt rather than merely documented or omitted.<br><br>Rather than filling gaps with certainty, Hartman embraces uncertainty and seeks to create a different kind of historical narrative – one that resists reducing enslaved people to quantities listed as anonymous victims and property. She challenges conventional historiography that relies on colonial records as neutral sources, emphasizing that the archive itself is a site of power, where enslaved people’s lives are often recorded only in relation to punishment, death, or sale.<br><br></div>
      <blockquote class="block-quote">“When we shift our emphasis from historical recovery to rigorous and responsible creativity, we recognize that archives are not just the records bequeathed to us by the past; archives also consist of the tools we use to explore it, the vision that allows us to read its signs, and the design decisions that communicate our sense of history’s possibilities,&quot;</blockquote>

      <div class="location">Location: Atlantic Ocean</div>
      <div class="text-block-8">IIn various poetry collections, the Atlantic Ocean is personified as a witness to history, seeing, writing, and roaring amongst other actions. For Dannabang Kuwabong in “Burning in Maroon Camp”, in <a href="https://www.mawenzihouse.com/product/voices-from-kibuli-country/"><em class="hyperlink">Voices from Kibuli Country</em>,</a> the ocean is a site that holds access to history as it is personified to actively participate in the process: “where the seabed writes our history on its waves”.<a href="#references" class="reference"><sup>5 </sup></a>There is a promise to keep the memory of the maroons – enslaved people who escaped – active. This is located in the seabed, right at the bottom of the ocean. Using this spatial image, he locates the history of transatlantic slavery as foundational to the Atlantic geography, its effects seen in the “waves” created on the surface.<br><br>“Progeny of the Air”, an early poem in Kwame Dawes’s collection <a href="https://www.coppercanyonpress.org/books/duppy-conqueror-by-kwame-dawes/"><em class="hyperlink">Duppy Conqueror</em></a>, opens with images of sea and foam, “The propellers undress the sea; / the pattern of foam like a broken zip / opening where the bow cuts the wave.”<a href="#" class="reference"><sup>6</sup></a> Commenting on this, a reviewer of the collection notes the relevance of the oceanic introduction: “This elegant image of unzipping the foam and opening the water is a brilliant initiation into the poem for the reader. Just as the water opens the wave, the poem opens to allow the reader to dive in.”<a href="#" class="reference"><sup>7</sup></a><br><br>Other oceanic images respond to precise historical moments. Poets Kwadwo Opoku-Agyemang<a href="#" class="reference"><sup>8</sup></a> and Kwesi Brew<a href="#references" class="reference"><sup>9</sup></a> locate their poems during specific years of early Portuguese colonization which began in 1482. Under the command of Captain Don Diego d&#x27;Azambuja, Portuguese ships arrived in the coastal town Elmina, in what is present-day Cape Coast, Ghana. Kwamena Ansa, King of Elmina in the 15th century, interacted with Portuguese traders and negotiated alliances and trading agreements, highlighting African leaders&#x27; agency in navigating these early encounters with European powers. Bayo Holseycalls Ansa a “local legend” in oral tradition surrounding the history of Elmina and the region.<a href="#references" class="reference"><sup>10</sup></a> The legend holds that Don Diego d&#x27;Azambuja met with King Ansa who initially rejected the request. He said Don Diego d&#x27;Azambuja should watch the waves of the sea and study their rhythm – approaching the shore only to retreat again. He asked that the Portuguese follow this natural cycle, coming to Elmina for trade and then returning to Portugal, without erecting a permanent structure.<br><br>However, after repeated appeals, offering of gifts and threats of violence, Ansa eventually relented and permitted the construction of what is now known as Elmina Castle. His giving in is sometimes interpreted as a pragmatic move to secure trade benefits, as a gesture of diplomacy or as a reluctant concession to external pressure. Thus, the Portuguese established São Jorge da Mina Castle (Elmina Castle): the first permanent European building in West Africa.<br>‍</div>

      <div class="text-block-8">Poet Kwesi Brew brings these scenes to life in <a href="https://www.africanbookscollective.com/books/return-of-no-returns-and-other-poems"><em class="hyperlink">Return of No Return</em></a><em>.</em>
        <a href="#references" class="reference"><sup>11</sup></a> Telling the story of Portuguese soldier Don Diego arriving in Ghana, Brew depicts the economic motives for early European invasion of Africa, driven by access to minerals and resources. Edina’s King, Kwamina Ansa, ruled the region when the Portuguese arrived. He is also known as “Nana Kwamena Ansah” which is who “Nana” in his poetry refers to. The social consequences of the invasion were severe, with wars and communities turning against each other. As Brew predicts, “brother shall fight brother.”<a href="#" class="reference"><sup>12</sup></a><br><br>Sibilance (s-alliteration) is present throughout the beginning of the poem: describing the river as “sweet, slow” and “strange sweet waters.” Initially, sibilance adds to the beautification of the setting, providing a rhythmic sense of calm. Later, sibilance, which may also resemble hissing, turns to create a more ominous setting as “strangers with swords”<a href="#references" class="reference"><sup>14</sup></a> arrive, and the sun reflects the shine of unsheathed swords. Telling the story of Don Diego D’Azambuja’s arrival, and the subsequent violence that followed, Brew paints a scene of greed for gold and raw materials: “emeralds, diamonds, sapphires, and gold, / Gold, gold, and gold.”<a href="#references" class="reference"><sup>15</sup></a> Listed and repeated, the poet highlights Edina’s abundant resources.<br><br>The sea is a witness to the ordeal, compared to “a face concentrated in thought.”<a href="#references" class="reference"><sup>16</sup></a> Though silent and dormant, there is an allure to the ocean, associated with royalty and contemplation: the rivers, too, must serve the “majesty of the sea.”<a href="#" class="reference"><sup>17</sup></a> Water is given agency, one that is used towards connection, healing, and kinship. Where the river and the sea meet, they “join[ing] allegiance”, consolidating the bond of the geographical region. In a similar sense, the rivers are said to “refresh friends” after they have been divided by greed for gold: offering a restoration and healing after hostility and loss.<br><br>“El Mina: 1498”, from the collection <a href="https://www.africanbookscollective.com/books/cape-coast-castle"><em class="hyperlink">Cape Coast Castle</em>,</a> is dated 16 years after the Portuguese arrived on Ghana’s coast.<a href="#references" class="reference"><sup>18</sup></a> Kwadwo Opoku-Agyemang, in this poem, situates the sea as a witness to the violence brought by colonization: “The sea saw them all / But unable to talk Today mumbles and roars by turn / And the win still turns in the chill”.<a href="#references" class="reference"><sup>19</sup></a> This violence includes infections, force by weaponry, enslavement, the imposition of religion, and corruption – all mentioned to different degrees in the poem.<br><br>The sounds of the sea, mumbling and roaring, speak to confusion, anger, and unease. Though it is “unable to talk” the emotional residue and trauma are relayed through sound. The sea is an ancient body; bearer of historical memory from the 1400s to the present. But this memory is also undetectable seeing as it is unable to communicate with us. It is, too, as a poignant reminder of what is inaccessible in the archive.<br><br>Professor of Aesthetics Elaine Scarry, in <em>The Body in Pain</em>, writes that pain is fundamentally unshareable: though a person may hear of another’s pain, it “belong[s] in an invisible geography.”<a href="#references" class="reference"><sup>20</sup></a> Arguing that language is limited in its ability to fully express pain since this is a felt sensation, Scarry says that the suffering person resorts to infantile outcry, to “the sounds and cries a human being makes before language is learned.”<a href="#references" class="reference"><sup>21</sup></a> In this way, pain “actively destroys language.”<a href="#references" class="reference"><sup>22</sup></a> Here, in these images of the ocean’s emotive sounds, we see suffering is projected onto the ocean as a witness to the pain experienced by the enslaved and the colonized. The inanimate world emits affective expressions, the residue of violence in the aftermath of colonization and slavery. The watery “body” succeeds in vocalisation – mumbling and roaring – but, “unable to talk”, cannot articulate what passed. Pain, in the aftermath of slavery, is not only incommunicable but projected further away from the human body onto the ocean. As the poem recreates memory, it locates the cries of affliction in the environment and the place of atrocity itself.<br>‍

      <div class="text-block-6">As a bearer of stories, the ocean also carries the promise of liberation. Almost 200 years later, in 1839, slaves captured on the Cape Coast successfully overthrew their captors on board the Spanish slave boat named Amistad. Sengbe Pieh led the revolt against slavers and ordered the captain to sail into the sun, back to Africa. They were captured by the US Navy off the coast of Long Island, NY where a trial followed. The court ultimately ruled in favour of the enslaved, asserting that the captives were free individuals that had been kidnapped – and denying the slavery as a legitimate trade. As one may expect, this Rebellion marked a key moment in the history of slavery.<br><br>The ocean, in Kwadwo Opoku-Agyemang’s poem “Sengbe Pieh”, named after the leader, is embraced once liberation is achieved: as Sengbe Pieh returns to Africa, the image of the sea’s foam is described affectionately as a “white kiss on the horizon.” Sengbe Pieh is said to return “as sea” itself: embodying the expansiveness of the space as an indication of his influential leadership. In becoming one with the sea, his story and its legacy survives with the permanence of the ocean.<br><br>In the contemporary period, the Atlantic Ocean is an important site for diasporic memory. Migrants who have voluntarily migrated from Ghana to the USA draw on the ocean in their attempt at remembrance. The speaker in Ama Ata Aidoo’s “Homesickness” has traveled to a foreign country, outside Ghana, and finding themself at a fish market where all the labels are in English, becomes frustrated for they cannot remember the Fantse names for the fish. When they try to recall the Fantse names for the fish, the sounds of the Atlantic Ocean interrupt and mimic the frustration with which these memories are attempted to be recollected. The sounds are aggressive, for the ocean “booms and roars.” At other times, it is personified to “calmly creep[s]”, adding slyness to its character.<br><br>The ocean switches between contradictory dispositions: it is either bold and aggressive or quiet and sly:</div>
      <blockquote class="block-quote">while from distant places in my head <br>the Atlantic booms and roars or  <br>calmly creeps swishing foam on the hot sand. <br>But I could not remember their Fantse names.</blockquote>
      <div class="text-block-6">Enjambment leaves one to linger on “or”, highlighting the ocean’s juxtaposing states. This erratic body of water is located in far-away places in the speaker’s “head” – the ocean itself is an emblem of memory, a site which must be crossed to access the language of home in Ghana. It is internalised, becoming one with the speaker’s state of mind.<br><br>The significance of the ocean is shared beyond Ghana too. Poets such as South Africa’s Koleka Putuma behold the waves as a non-specific reminder of slavery. In her poem ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dfq3C8GNrE">Water’</a>, blackness is conceived through the histories of the ocean. The unchangeable qualities of the ocean – its saltiness – is a permanent reminder of the enslaved:</div>

      <div class="text-block-8">Conceptualising a methodology of “carrying”, Nirma Puwar (2021) calls herself a “living diasporic archive”, an “inter-generational researcher-daughter carrier” who carries the sensibilities, sounds, aesthetics, and traumas of generations before her. She expresses how transgenerational and transnational experiences come to form us as embodied archives of “transnational diasporic dislocations”. The things we carry across time and space can be tangible objects that become inanimate witnesses of history.<br><br>‍</div>
      <div class="location">Location: Nile River</div>
      <div class="text-block-8">The Nile River is another body of water that, like the Atlantic Ocean, incites historical memory. For Gabriel Awuah Mainoo, its waters are sacred – fit for “baptism”, a place to connect with ancestry and community. Its sacredness is its access to lineage: to have “bodies washed in ancient semen” (15).<br><br>In “Adventure, blood culture &amp; familiarity” (from his collection <em>We are Moulting Birds</em>), witnessing history is less about sight and more about feeling and smell: to reach the community of past generations, the speaker enters a specific shebeen that will allow the memories to resurface prior to being “baptized” at the Nile. Sight is permanently barred by “perennial darkness” and connecting with the past is difficult for one must forcefully “throw” himself into the shebeen and “crane your eyes” to find his “brothers” (15). One may argue that darkness heightens the other senses – smells of spider plant and powdered okra in the shebeen, both common African plants eaten on the continent. Smell is also the means by which the connection to past generations, to this community of brothers, is established: “you love them for their distinct cologne” (15). These smells are, however, unpleasant: arising from “dirty beaches, dead cockroaches sheltered in saline swamp &amp; shit &amp; moldy water” (15), a reminder of the violence of the past. Describing it as “cologne”, a perfume associated with masculinity that tends to have a stronger, more leathery smell, the speaker transforms repulsion into beauty (compared to alluring perfume) and strength (masculine in character), embracing the resilience of those who survived these conditions. It also displays his affection towards the brothers that have come before him. <br>‍<br>Baptism is a symbolic ritual for spiritual rebirth. Here, we see this rebirth is not about the future. Rather, it is realized by connecting with the past. It is then significant that this ritual occurs at the Nile River in Egypt, rich with Ancient history and pan-African meaning. The river flows through eleven countries, including Egypt, Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, and Uganda. The Nile defies the rigid colonial borders established at the 1884 Berlin Conference and racialized distinctions often drawn between “Black” Sub-Saharan Africa and Northern Africa. It was significant in Ancient Egypt and the kingdoms of Nubia and Kush, modern-day Sudan, as a transportation route. The Nile allowed these kingdoms to gain in prosperity. It had predictable flooding cycles which allowed for the development of complex agricultural systems. It also had religious significance as Ancient Egyptians saw the river as a divine gift from the gods, particularly the gods Hapi and Orisis. Awuah Mainoo’s phrase “baptism at the Nile” suggests a shared heritage and a sense of being cleansed or initiated into a collective African experience. The “baptism” implies a spiritual connection to Africa’s past, a metaphorical cleansing of shared trauma.</div>
